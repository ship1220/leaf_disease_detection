# Leaf Disease Detection using MobileNetV2  

## Overview  
This project applies **deep learning and computer vision** to detect plant leaf diseases from images.  
Using **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight and efficient CNN architecture, the model classifies plant leaves into multiple disease categories and provides confidence scores for each prediction.  

The trained model is deployed through a **Streamlit web app**, allowing users to upload a leaf image and get real-time predictions — supporting early detection and sustainable agriculture.

##  Dataset  
- **Source:** [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)  
- **Images:** 50,000+ labeled leaf images (healthy & diseased)  
- **Classes:** 14+ disease categories  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Image resizing to 224×224  
  - Normalization to [0,1]  
  - Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

##  Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Loading:** Mounted dataset from Google Drive in Colab.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Used `ImageDataGenerator` for normalization and augmentation.  
3. **Model Building:** Loaded and customized MobileNetV2 using TensorFlow/Keras.  
4. **Training:** Trained for 15 epochs using Colab GPU.  
5. **Evaluation:** Analyzed accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  
6. **Deployment:** Integrated model into Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Streamlit App  
Upload a leaf image (`.jpg` / `.png`) to get:  
- Predicted disease name   
- Model confidence score  
- Health status indicator (Healthy / Diseased)  

**Run locally:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
